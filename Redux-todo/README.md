# Redux Todo Application

A simple yet comprehensive Todo application built with React and Redux Toolkit to demonstrate Redux state management principles.

## üìñ Overview

This application demonstrates the core concepts of Redux state management in a React application through a simple Todo list application. It allows users to add and remove todo items, with all state managed centrally through Redux.

## üß© Key Components

### 1. Redux Store (`src/app/store.js`)

The Redux store serves as the central state container for the entire application:

```javascript
// Configures the Redux store with todoReducer as the root reducer
export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: todoReducer
});
```

**Key Points:**
- Created using Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` function
- Uses a single reducer (todoReducer) for simplicity in this application
- Automatically sets up Redux DevTools extension integration
- Adds middleware like Redux Thunk for handling async actions

### 2. Todo Slice (`src/features/todo/todoSlice.js`)

The Todo slice encapsulates the state and operations for todo items:

```javascript
export const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todo',
    initialState,
    reducers:{
        addTodo: (state, action) =>{
            const todo = {
                id: nanoid(),
                text: action.payload,
            }
            state.todos.push(todo);
        },
        removeTodo: (state, action) => {
            state.todos = state.todos.filter((todo)=>todo.id != action.payload);
        },
    }
});
```

**Key Points:**
- Created using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` function
- Defines the initial state for todos
- Implements two reducer functions:
  - `addTodo`: Creates a new todo with unique ID and adds it to the state
  - `removeTodo`: Removes a todo by filtering out the one with matching ID
- Exports action creators and reducer functions automatically generated by Redux Toolkit

### 3. AddTodo Component (`src/components/AddTodo.jsx`)

This component handles user input for adding new todos:

```javascript
function AddTodo() {
    const [input, setInput] = useState('');
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    const addTodoHandler = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        dispatch(addTodo(input));
        setInput('');
    }
    
    // Form rendering...
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Uses local state with `useState` for form input
- Accesses the Redux dispatch function using `useDispatch` hook
- Dispatches the `addTodo` action when form is submitted
- Clears input field after submission

### 4. Todos Component (`src/components/Todos.jsx`)

This component displays the list of todos and provides UI for removing them:

```javascript
function Todos() {
    const todos = useSelector(state => state.todos);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    
    // Rendering todo list with remove buttons...
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Retrieves todos from Redux store using `useSelector` hook
- Dispatches `removeTodo` action when delete button is clicked for a todo
- Maps through todos array to render each as a list item

### 5. App Component (`src/App.jsx`)

The root component that renders the application UI:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Vite + React + Redux</h1>
      <AddTodo />
      <Todos />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Acts as a container for the application
- Renders the AddTodo and Todos components

### 6. Main Entry Point (`src/main.jsx`)

Sets up the application and Redux provider:

```javascript
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
)
```

**Key Points:**
- Wraps the App component with Redux `Provider`
- Makes the Redux store available throughout the component tree

## üîÑ Redux Data Flow

### Adding a Todo:
1. User enters text and submits form in `AddTodo` component
2. Component dispatches `addTodo` action with text as payload
3. Todo slice's `addTodo` reducer:
   - Creates a new todo object with unique ID and input text
   - Adds the new todo to the state
4. Redux notifies subscribed components of state changes
5. `Todos` component re-renders with updated list

### Removing a Todo:
1. User clicks the delete button for a todo in `Todos` component
2. Component dispatches `removeTodo` action with todo ID as payload
3. Todo slice's `removeTodo` reducer:
   - Filters out the todo with matching ID
   - Updates the state with filtered array
4. Redux notifies subscribed components of state changes
5. `Todos` component re-renders with updated list

## üîç Redux Toolkit Features Utilized

1. **`createSlice`**:
   - Simplifies reducer logic and action creation
   - Handles immutable updates via Immer library
   - Auto-generates action creators

2. **`configureStore`**:
   - Sets up Redux store with good defaults
   - Automatically configures middleware
   - Integrates with Redux DevTools

3. **Immer Integration**:
   - Allows "mutating" code in reducers (like `state.todos.push()`)
   - Converts these operations to immutable updates under the hood

4. **Redux Hooks**:
   - `useDispatch`: Access the dispatch function to send actions
   - `useSelector`: Extract data from the Redux store state

## üß† Key Redux Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Single Source of Truth**:
   - All application state is stored in a single Redux store

2. **State is Read-Only**:
   - State can only be changed by dispatching actions

3. **Changes Made with Pure Functions**:
   - Reducers are pure functions that specify how state changes

4. **Centralized State Management**:
   - Components access and modify state through Redux

5. **Unidirectional Data Flow**:
   - Data flows one way: State ‚Üí View ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí State

## üöÄ Learning Outcomes

By studying this application, you'll understand:

- How to structure a Redux application with Redux Toolkit
- How to create and configure a Redux store
- How to define state and reducers using createSlice
- How to dispatch actions from React components
- How to access Redux state in React components
- How Redux implements one-way data flow

## üîß Extensions and Improvements

Potential enhancements to further explore Redux concepts:

1. Add todo editing functionality
2. Add todo completion toggling
3. Implement filtering (all, active, completed)
4. Persist todos in localStorage
5. Add async operations with createAsyncThunk
6. Add multiple slices for more complex state
